**Java Programming Tasks**

This repository contains a set of Java programming tasks designed to practice basic Java syntax, control structures, and use of the Scanner class for input processing. Each task is designed to solve a specific problem, ranging from counting characters in a string to checking for palindromes and validating mathematical expressions.


**Tasks Overview**

Task 1: Counts the number of occurrences of the letter 'a' in a given string.

Task 2: Reverses a given string and displays the result.

Task 3: Checks if a given string is a palindrome.

Task 4: Sums up all digits found in a given string.

Task 5: Checks if the parentheses in a given mathematical expression are balanced.



**Task Details**

Task 1 (Zadanie1.java): Prompts the user to enter a string and counts how many times the letter 'a' appears in it.

Task 2 (Zadanie2.java): Asks the user to provide a word, which is then reversed and displayed.

Task 3 (Zadanie3.java): Requests a word from the user and checks whether it is a palindrome.

Task 4 (Zadanie4.java): Prompts the user to enter a word containing numbers, then calculates and displays the sum of those numbers.

Task 5 (Zadanie5.java): Asks for a mathematical expression to check the correctness of the parentheses placement.
